Our application, centred on individuals struggling with drug abuse, aligns with the
principles of Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) - Peace, Justice, and Strong
Institutions, serving as a global framework for promoting peace, justice, and stability while
acknowledging the unique challenges these individuals face on their journey towards recovery.
Our application aims to achieve SDG Target 16.1, which seeks to significantly reduce
violence and related death rates worldwide. It emphasizes on creating a safer world by
addressing violence, abuse and crime. We acknowledge the frequent correlation between
substance abuse and violent behaviours, as supported by data from Harrison & Gfroerer (1992,
as cited in Craddock, A., 1994), which reveals that in 1991, 26.1% of drug users confessed to
engaging in violent crimes. Furthermore, the alarming rise in drug overdose deaths, with over
106,000 reported in National Center for Health Statistics 2021, underscores the urgent need for
intervention (Drug Overdose Death Rates, 2023). Our apps are dedicated to addressing these
issues by providing crucial support and resources to individuals in their journey towards
recovery, ultimately contributing to a safer, more peaceful world.
